## Summary

President Trump establishes new requirements for voter verification and ballot counting procedures.

## Details

The executive order implements several measures to address election integrity:

- Requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration
- Mandates that ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted
- Directs federal agencies to share citizenship data with state election officials
- Requires voting systems to produce voter-verifiable paper records
- Prohibits non-citizens from being involved in election administration
- Rescinds previous executive order on promoting voting access (EO 14019)

## Context

The order cites election practices in other countries like India, Brazil, Germany, and Canada as models for more secure voting procedures. It specifically targets mail-in voting, non-citizen voting, and electronic voting systems as areas requiring stricter regulation.
